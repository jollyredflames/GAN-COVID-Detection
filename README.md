# GAN-COVID-Detection
An implementation of the pix2pix network to work for anomaly detection in chest scans. The architecture should help detect anamoly chest scans and can help reduce medical burden by pre-screening lungs which have no obvious signs of viral/bacterial infection. We envision the optimal system assigning priorities to patients to ensure the most dire patients get prioritized in healthcare, although this research only aims to measure the accuracy of the Generator/Discriminator model using the AUC curve.

To rerun our implementation, please place code in a Google Colab Notebook and simply run the blocks. All datasets must be uploaded to Google Drive and permission must be granted in order for this to work.
